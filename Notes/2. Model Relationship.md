In Django, relationships between models are defined to represent how data in different tables (models) is connected. 
- One-to-One Relationship
- Many-to-One Relationship
- Many-to-Many Relationship

## One-to-One Relationship
- Each record in one model is related to **exactly one** record in another model. 
- It is similar to a unique relationship or `"is a"` relationship.
- Field Used: OneToOneField

Example: For extending a user profile, where each user has a unique profile.
```python
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

class Profile(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(
        User,
        on_delete=models.CASCADE,
        related_name='profile'  # Access the profile via `user.profile`
    )
    bio = models.TextField()
```

Accessing the relationship
```python
user = User.objects.get(id=1)
profile = user.profile  # Reverse access
```

## Many-to-One Relationship
- Many records in one model are related to a single record in another model. 
- It represents `"belongs to"` or `"has many"` relationships.
- Field Used: ForeignKey

Example: A blog post can have many comments, but each comment belongs to one blog post.

```python
class BlogPost(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    content = models.TextField()

class Comment(models.Model):
    blog_post = models.ForeignKey(BlogPost, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    text = models.TextField()

```

## Many-to-Many Relationship
- Many records in one model are related to many records in another model. 
- This is used for `"many-to-many"` associations.
- Field Used: ManyToManyField

Example: A student can enroll in multiple courses, and a course can have multiple students.

```python
class Course(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Student(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    courses = models.ManyToManyField(Course)

```
